learn to use the 'puter

# L1

So you know next to nothing other than computer has a screen and does some cool stuff
You made it here so I'm just gonna assume you at least know how to use that jawnson

Our very first step here is to learn the basics of programming, preferably in an easy language like [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
There's several other languages good for beginners but this is the best in my opinion
**AS YOU INSTALL** There should be a box labeled "Add Python 3.x.x to PATH", I highly recommend checking this box as it'll probably help you out later down the road.

Next, we'll need an IDE, which is a little code area that'll help us edit, make, manage, and run our code and files. If you want something Python specific, you can use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), however I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it's universal, fast, and really easy to use

### ----- What to learn (Ordered) -----
- Basic programming functions like printing, performing operations on numbers, user input
- If/Else statements
- Functions, parameters, arguments
- Data types like int, string, float/double
- Arrays
- Loops and the different ways they're utilized
- Basic understanding of documentation websites
- Basic problem breakdown and solving skills
- Read everything below, ESPECIALLY including ***How do I “Problem Solve?”***

This will likely take a little while, don't just watch a video or two and have a basic understanding of their concepts. True understanding and knowledge comes through **experience**, which takes lots of **time**, **failure**, **mistakes**, and most importantly, **projects**.

This stage of your learning is hands down the most important part of your entire journey. Without a very strong understanding of the **fundamentals of programming itself**, you won't be able to get anywhere on your own. Keep in mind the fundamentals are significantly different and more important than the programming language itself. Things like real problem solving skills and the ability to break a problem down into individually solvable parts are incredibly useful, impossible to move on without. As tedious and boring as it might get, I can't reiterate enough that you need to **REALLY TRULY** understand these first few lessons, to the point of where any project or problem could be provided to you within your skill level and you should be able to pull it off within a **reasonable amount of time** with minimal problems.

One thing I will note, very early on, is that AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, or whatever else you might use have the ability to generate code for you. I **STRONGLY** advise against this as a beginner, as it **will** get you almost nowhere and you'll end up missing many of the basic **problem solving** skills that come along with programming. If you're truly stuck, I say it's okay to ask it where a bug might be happening in your code as it can be useful to identify things like that, however keep in mind that mistakes are very common from the AI and a good percentage of the time, code that's generated often won't work as expected, or won't work at all.

### ----- How do I "Problem Solve?" -----

Problem solving is a widely under-talked about aspect of programming, which is why I'm writing a mini lesson on it here. For the most part, this skill should develop naturally with time and experience but it's good to read a bit about it,

So what's even meant by problem solving? We can all solve problems can't we? Most of us probably wouldn't even be here if we didn't have SOME form of these skills right? Well, though those questions may be correct, they may not be as strong as you think they are, no offense intended.

For your first little exercise, imagine yourself as the developer of a little 2D mobile game. The game's nothing super serious, but the general idea for it is for you to be able to build your own terrarium and decorate it with your own plants, soils, bugs, animals, and whatever else might be included in a terrarium. You probably already have some more advanced ideas for this game, which is great, **creativity goes a LONG way** in programming. Now, I want you to think, what's the VERY FIRST, absolutely most basic thing you need to get done once you start coding your game. Some common answers to this are getting a terrarium on screen, making plant models, or making moving bugs. While these aren't exactly bad answers, they're not exactly as simple as they might seem. What do we need that's even more simple than that? If you guessed a window that we can even display stuff on, congratulations, you're already figuring it out better than 90% of most beginners. The VERY first thing we need is a little window we're able to even draw or display stuff on in the first place. From there, what's the next step? Well, the whole idea of having this window is to display stuff, so let's try drawing a line, or perhaps a square on the screen. From there, we can make the square move from left to right. Then we can draw a little box around our square, our first little "terrarium." As time goes on, we keep building up and up, making our little box slightly more and more complicated until we finally have something that resembles a terrarium, dirt, little bugs, and so on.

If you haven't caught on already, the point to this lesson is to teach that in programming, it's far too easy to try and start out too big. If we tried to start out by making moving bugs and plants that would grow as time went on, we probably would have to end up changing a LOT of their code in the future, assuming we even got that far in the first place. If we had their textures, models, and even some code that could be usable, what would we use them on? We have no window to render these plants, no physics engine, and not even and object system in place. You can't start building a skyscraper from the top. Never forget how important it is to start small and simple, to break your idea down into its smallest most simple parts and start putting it together from there.

### ----- Project Ideas -----

So you've developed a pretty basic understanding of programming. You know how to write little functions that do simple things like add, or print a user's name based off some given input. Now your task is to make some mini projects to develop your skills. You'll quickly discover that it's pretty hard to come up with project ideas, which is something I'd say you can ask AI to give you some ideas on, so here's a list of some little project ideas for your skill level. The goal behind all of these is to utilize almost everything you've learned so far, as well as to help develop a deeper understanding of how they work and identify and weird quirks they may have.

- Command Line Calculator, which prompts the user for an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and 2 numbers to perform the operation on. The program should then print the output to the console and continue asking for an operation until the user enters "Q" or some other option to exit.
- Fizzbuzz, a classic beginner programming challenge. Given a user entered integer **n**, for every positive integer **i <= n**, the task is to print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5, and "Fizzbuzz" if it's divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Find largest number, which repeatedly prompts the user for a number until they enter a negative integer. From there, it should print out the sum of every integer entered as well as the largest, and maybe even smallest numbers entered. There are multiple ways to solve this one, try to start doing so by using an array, then explore other options.

### ----- Resources -----

One of the hardest parts of learning how to program is **learning how to learn in the first place**. It's really easy to just search up some YouTube videos and say you've learned a lot when in reality, you don't know as much as you think. Below is a list of resources to help you get started. I recommend if there's anything you run across in here that you don't know how to read or aren't sure what it means/does, please take the time to look into it and figure it out.

So you've made it this far, farther than most people really. By now, you should  have spent at least a couple weeks learning and writing mini programs and maybe even gone beyond.

### ----- What to learn (Ordered) -----
- File importing and multi-file programs
